## Dynamic Memory Allocation in C programming (use of MALLOC)
- Malloc is used for dynamic memory allocation and is useful when you don't know the amount of memory needed during compile time. Allocating memory allows objects to exist beyond the scope of the current block. C passes by value instead of reference.
